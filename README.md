## ðŸ§  Introduction

**Breast MRI** plays a pivotal role in breast cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment planning. However, most existing segmentation models fail to distinguish between the left and right breasts, which limits their usefulness in downstream tasks such as unilateral classification or post-mastectomy analysis.

In this work, we introduce the **first publicly available large-scale dataset with explicit left and right breast segmentation labels**, comprising **over 13,000 3D MRI scans**. Accompanying this dataset is a **robust nnU-Netâ€“based segmentation model**, trained specifically to identify and separate left and right breast regions in clinical MRI data. This effort provides a foundation for developing high-quality, anatomically aware tools for breast MRI analysis and offers opportunities for large-scale pretraining.

**Coming Soon!**

Upon official release, this repository will include:

- ðŸ”¹ The complete **13k+ MRI scan dataset** with left/right segmentation masks.
- ðŸ”¹ A pre-trained **nnU-Net model** for robust leftâ€“right breast segmentation.
- ðŸ”¹ Docker Container fÃ¼r easy deployment

Stay tuned for updates! ðŸš€
